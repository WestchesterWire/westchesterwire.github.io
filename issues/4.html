      <h2 class="story__headline">The Epstein depositions come to <em>Chappaqua</em></h2>
      <div class="story__byline">By the Wire Staff &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Friday, Feb. 27</div>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>A town famous for apple orchards and quiet train-platform celebrity sightings just became the center of one of the biggest political stories in the country. <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> testified <strong>Thursday, February 26</strong> before the <strong>U.S. House Oversight Committee</strong> — behind closed doors — at <strong>Chappaqua Crossing</strong>, the sprawling former <strong>Reader's Digest</strong> campus that's served as her home base for years.</p>
        <p>Today — <strong>Friday, February 27</strong> — it's <strong>Bill's</strong> turn. He becomes the <strong>first former U.S. president in over a century to testify before Congress</strong>. Also at Chappaqua Crossing. Also closed-door. The committee is examining the Clintons' ties to the late <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> as part of its broader investigation into Epstein's network.</p>
        <p>Hillary's statement from Thursday was characteristically measured. Whether that moves the needle for the committee — or the public — remains to be seen. Bill's testimony, whatever it is, won't be public immediately. But this is a historic moment happening right here in our backyard, at a building most locals know as the place that used to have a great holiday market.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <p>"I had no idea about their criminal activities. I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein." &mdash; Hillary Clinton, Thursday testimony</p>
      </blockquote>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>For <strong>Chappaqua</strong>, a village of about 1,400 people in the <strong>Town of New Castle</strong>, this is a surreal week. National media, security details, and committee staff have descended on a town that normally gets attention only when a Clinton is spotted at their local coffee shop. The Clintons have lived on <strong>Old House Lane</strong> for decades — it's been a quiet arrangement that locals have largely accepted as part of the landscape.</p>
        <p>Today's testimony won't be public. But the fact that it's happening here — in our county, on a campus built by a magazine that once symbolized optimistic American storytelling — is not lost on anyone paying attention.</p>

      <div class="story__body">
        <p><strong>Westchester County Police</strong> and their law enforcement partners announced <strong>Wednesday, February 25</strong> that they're ramping up patrols at <strong>houses of worship</strong> countywide for the next two months. The timing covers <strong>Ramadan</strong>, <strong>Passover</strong>, <strong>Lent</strong>, and <strong>Easter</strong> — a stretch of overlapping religious observances that brings more people to places of worship across the county.</p>
        <p>There's no specific threat driving this — it's a proactive measure the county has taken before during high-attendance religious seasons. If your congregation has security concerns or wants to coordinate with local law enforcement, this is a good time to make that call. Details are up at <strong>westchestergov.com</strong>.</p>
