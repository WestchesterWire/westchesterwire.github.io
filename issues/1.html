        <p>A historic nor'easter is dumping up to <strong>20 inches of snow</strong> across Westchester County right now, with <strong>blizzard conditions</strong> — sustained winds topping <strong>55 mph</strong>, near-zero visibility, and snowfall rates of <strong>2-3 inches per hour</strong> — expected through Monday evening. This is the most significant winter storm to hit the region since January 2016.</p>
        <p>Three separate states of emergency are in effect. <strong>Governor Hochul</strong> activated <strong>100 National Guard members</strong> and placed <strong>5,600 utility workers</strong> on standby statewide. <strong>County Executive Ken Jenkins</strong> declared a county emergency effective <strong>6 p.m. Sunday</strong>, and <strong>Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano</strong> followed suit for the city. Snow Emergency Routes in Yonkers are active — your car <em>will</em> get ticketed or towed if it's parked on one.</p>

      <h3 class="story__headline">The county just closed a $197 million budget hole — and <em>you're</em> paying for part of it</h3>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>County Executive <strong>Ken Jenkins</strong> signed the <strong>2026 county budget</strong> — a <strong>$2.5 billion</strong> spending plan that closes a <strong>$197.7 million gap</strong> through a mix of belt-tightening and your wallet. Nearly every county department got hit with <strong>8% cuts</strong>, including Jenkins' own office. <strong>180 positions</strong> have been eliminated through a hard hiring freeze (no layoffs). And for the first time in <strong>seven years</strong>, property taxes are going up — a <strong>3.7% increase</strong> that works out to roughly <strong>$60 more per year</strong> on a $500K-assessed home.</p>
        <p>Jenkins blamed the squeeze on federal policy shifts, calling it a <strong>"Trump tax increase"</strong> driven by slashed aid, tariff pressure, and ballooning mandated costs — healthcare alone jumped <strong>$65 million</strong>. On the capital side, the county's <strong>$605 million plan</strong> includes <strong>94 new hybrid buses</strong>, <strong>$150 million</strong> for Yonkers wastewater upgrades, <strong>$50 million</strong> for housing programs, and <strong>$35 million</strong> for EV chargers at 77 sites across the county.</p>

      <strong>&#129482; Taconic ice chaos</strong> — Sleet paralyzed the Taconic State Parkway during Friday morning rush hour, causing <strong>at least 10 crashes</strong> between Poughkeepsie and northern Putnam before 10:30 a.m. State police blamed excessive speed for conditions. One minor injury reported. &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;
      <strong>&#128739; Route 100 is back</strong> — The stretch over the Muscoot Reservoir in northern Westchester <strong>finally reopened Feb. 20</strong> after a months-long culvert replacement project. Commuters in Somers and Yorktown, your detour days are over. &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;
      <strong>&#127760; Bookmark this</strong> — Westchester County's website is moving from westchestergov.com to <strong>WestchesterCountyNY.gov</strong> on <strong>March 2</strong>, per a federal mandate requiring .gov domains for government sites. Update your bookmarks. &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;
      <strong>&#9851;&#65039; Recycling flex</strong> — A new county Waste Reduction Study confirms Westchester recycles at a <strong>50% rate</strong>, well above New York State's 43% average. The county's food scrap program now serves <strong>26 municipalities</strong> and diverted over <strong>1,100 tons</strong> in 2024. Take the win.
