      <h2 class="story__headline">Your Con Ed bill just went up &mdash; and you already owe <em>back pay</em></h2>
      <div class="story__byline">Multiple sources &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Wednesday, Feb. 25</div>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>If you felt a little lighter in the wallet this month, there's a reason. The <strong>Public Service Commission</strong> unanimously approved Con Edison's three-year rate plan on <strong>January 22</strong> &mdash; but the new rates are <strong>retroactive to January 1</strong>. That means you've been billed at 2025 rates for the first three weeks of the year, and Con Ed is coming to collect the difference.</p>
        <p>Your <strong>electric bill is going up roughly 3.5% this year</strong> &mdash; about <strong>$5 to $7 more per month</strong> for the average Westchester household. <strong>Gas is climbing 4.4%</strong>, or about <strong>$10.67 more per month</strong>. Over three years, electric goes up roughly <strong>9% total</strong>, gas about <strong>6%</strong>.</p>
        <p>Here's the thing, though &mdash; it was supposed to be <strong>much</strong> worse. Con Ed originally asked for a <strong>13.4% electric increase</strong> and a <strong>19% gas increase</strong>. The PSC cut that request by <strong>nearly 90%</strong>. A big reason? The <strong>Westchester Municipal Consortium</strong> &mdash; a coalition of <strong>40 Westchester towns, villages, and cities</strong> &mdash; banded together to fight the hike. They negotiated transparency requirements forcing Con Ed to hold annual meetings with local officials to review capital investment plans, compare spending in <strong>Westchester versus New York City</strong>, and address storm preparedness and infrastructure. Scarsdale Mayor <strong>Justin Arest</strong> said the coalition <strong>"demonstrated the strength of a unified voice in advocating for fairer energy costs."</strong></p>
      </div>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <p>"With this new increase, I don't know how I am going to survive with only one job." &mdash; Westchester resident, via News 12</p>
      </blockquote>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>What's driving the increase? Mostly <strong>property taxes</strong> &mdash; Con Ed estimates it'll pay over <strong>$3.2 billion</strong> in property taxes in 2026, and that gets passed straight to your bill. Add in <strong>$17 billion in infrastructure upgrades</strong> over three years, clean energy mandates under New York's climate law, and leak-prone pipe replacement on the gas side.</p>
        <p>The proceeding drew <strong>20,000 public comments</strong> &mdash; a record &mdash; and over <strong>70 elected officials</strong> signed a letter opposing the hike. State Senator <strong>Shelley Mayer</strong>, who hosted a <strong>"No Love for Con Ed" rally</strong> on Valentine's Day last year, is now pushing a bill to limit retroactive utility billing. For now, keep an eye on your next statement &mdash; the true-up is coming.</p>

      <h3 class="story__headline">If you speed on the Sprain, the DA has a message for you</h3>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>Westchester District Attorney <strong>Susan Cacace</strong> and <strong>New York State Police</strong> have launched <strong>D.A.S.H.</strong> &mdash; District Attorney's Safer Highways &mdash; a stepped-up enforcement initiative targeting the <strong>Sprain Brook Parkway</strong> and <strong>Interstate 684</strong> through the end of February. This isn't your standard speed trap. The DA's office has embedded <strong>two assistant district attorneys</strong> with State Police Troop K, reviewing cases in real time and flagging the worst offenders for criminal charges. As Cacace put it: <strong>"Slow down, or we'll do it for you."</strong> The program produced its first arrest on <strong>day one</strong> &mdash; a Connecticut parolee who led troopers on a chase up the Sprain before bailing out on foot in Greenburgh.</p>
        <p>The numbers behind the initiative are stark. <strong>DWI arrests in Westchester are up 41%</strong> since 2020. Car crashes countywide have <strong>risen 10% over five years</strong>. In 2024, troopers issued more than <strong>800 speeding citations</strong> just on the six-mile stretch of the Sprain in Greenburgh &mdash; and <strong>37,000+ speeding tickets</strong> were written countywide. And if you get caught, it's going to hurt more than it used to &mdash; New York's updated DMV point system took effect <strong>February 16</strong>, bumping a 1&ndash;10 mph over ticket from <strong>3 points to 4</strong> and lowering the license suspension threshold from 11 points in 18 months to <strong>10 points in 24 months</strong>. I-684 alone carries <strong>70,000+ vehicles a day</strong>. Drive accordingly.</p>

      <h3 class="story__headline">Mount Kisco just handed its police department to the county &mdash; and it's saving millions</h3>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>Instead of running its own police force, the <strong>Village of Mount Kisco</strong> has formalized an intermunicipal agreement with <strong>Westchester County</strong> for police services &mdash; a deal that saves taxpayers <strong>$2.4 million over the first five years</strong>. Under the agreement, the county will assign <strong>25 personnel</strong> to Mount Kisco: <strong>17 patrol officers</strong> (with a minimum of two on patrol at all times), <strong>3 detectives</strong>, and <strong>5 supervising sergeants</strong>. The village also gets access to the county's specialized units, investigative services, unified dispatch, and ongoing training.</p>
        <p>County Executive <strong>Ken Jenkins</strong> called it a smart model: <strong>"Policing is expensive... By working together, we are saving taxpayer dollars, maximizing existing County resources."</strong> Mount Kisco Mayor <strong>J. Michael Cindrich</strong> agreed, saying the deal <strong>"provides exceptional law enforcement services, at considerable cost savings."</strong> For Westchester's smaller municipalities struggling with rising costs, this could be the template &mdash; shared services that actually work.</p>
