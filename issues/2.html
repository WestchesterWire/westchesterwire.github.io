      <h2 class="story__headline">Westchester is digging out &mdash; and <em>nothing</em> is running yet</h2>
      <div class="story__byline">Multiple sources &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Monday, Feb. 23</div>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>If you're reading this and wondering whether you should go anywhere today &mdash; no. The Blizzard of '26 delivered exactly what it promised: <strong>12 to 18 inches</strong> across most of Westchester, with <strong>locally up to two feet</strong> in the northern part of the county. Wind gusts hit <strong>55 mph</strong> overnight, visibility dropped to near zero, and the Blizzard Warning remains in effect until <strong>6 p.m. tonight</strong>. This is the most significant winter storm to hit the region since January 2016.</p>
        <p>Here's the timeline for when things come back online. The <strong>countywide road ban</strong> &mdash; no non-essential vehicles on any road in the county &mdash; lifts at <strong>noon.</strong> <strong>Bee-Line buses and Paratransit</strong> are suspended until <strong>2 p.m.</strong>, so don't plan on catching a bus before mid-afternoon. <strong>Metro-North</strong> is running an <strong>hourly reduced schedule</strong> on the Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven lines, with weekend-level service on the branch lines. The Hudson Rail Link bus and Haverstraw-Ossining Ferry shuttles are <strong>fully suspended</strong>. If you commute on the Port Jervis or Pascack Valley lines, those are halted entirely &mdash; check NJ Transit.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>Schools are closed pretty much everywhere &mdash; <strong>Hawthorne-Cedar Knolls</strong>, <strong>The Masters School</strong>, the <strong>NY School for the Deaf</strong>, and <strong>Fordham's Westchester campus</strong> are all confirmed shut. <strong>Hastings-on-Hudson</strong> declared a village-wide snow emergency, canceling all activities. NYC called it a full snow day. If your district hasn't announced yet, assume the worst and check your school's website.</p>
        <p>Power outages have been mercifully light so far &mdash; <strong>161 Con Edison customers</strong> without power as of 8:15 a.m. out of 368,000+ &mdash; but with winds still gusting, that could change. Stay home. Dig out your car later. This one's still not done.</p>

      <h3 class="story__headline">After Bronx mall chaos, county police are watching Cross County Center</h3>
      <div class="story__body">
        <p>On <strong>February 16</strong>, several hundred teenagers swarmed <strong>Bay Plaza Shopping Center</strong> in the Bronx, causing property damage and panic that ended with <strong>18 arrests</strong> and multiple injuries. Within days, social media posts started circulating naming <strong>Westchester locations</strong> as potential next targets &mdash; including <strong>Cross County Center</strong> in Yonkers, along with other malls, libraries, and public venues across the county.</p>
        <p>The county's <strong>Real Time Crime Center</strong> is actively monitoring social media for organizing activity, and <strong>Commissioner Terrance Raynor</strong> had a blunt message for teens: <strong>"Do not participate."</strong> Police in <strong>Yonkers, Mount Vernon, and New Rochelle</strong> are all on heightened alert. If you see a large group gathering at a public venue, the county wants to hear about it: <strong>800-898-TIPS</strong> or tips@wccops.com.</p>
